# 3D Renderer in Rust

This project is a minimal Rust application using `wgpu` and `winit` to set up a window and prepare for 3D rendering. 

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
- Dependencies: `wgpu`, `winit` (already added)
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run`

## Next Steps
- Implement a rendering loop in `src/main.rs`
- Add 3D scene setup and rendering code

## Resources
- [wgpu documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu)
- [winit documentation](https://docs.rs/winit)

This README will be updated as the project progresses.
